# Security: SASL login (Phase 8)

Slice 8a: SASL/PLAIN and the login session. (ACLs are slice 8b, SCRAM 8c, the authorization matrix 8d, TLS 8e: their rules join
this file when they land.) What Apache Kafka 4.3.1 does, and the test that holds each. The source is the recordings
(`conformance/recordings/sasl-plain.json`, the step names are the oracle's) where there is one, else Kafka 4.3.1's own source,
read by item (`SaslServerAuthenticator` SSA, `PlainSaslServer`, `SocketServer`; the line numbers are in
`phase8/kafka-semantics.md` 3.1 to 3.9 and 6): **(source)** marks those. The pure parts are in `crates/kafka-auth`, the login
order in `crates/kafka-server/src/session*`, the flags in `crates/doze-kafka/src/cli/sasl.rs`.

## SEC-1. SASL is opt-in; without it nothing changes
No `--sasl-*` flag: no `Session` is made, the decoder trusts every connection, the connection loop has no extra branch, ApiVersions
does not list SaslHandshake or SaslAuthenticate, and a request for either closes the connection like any API not offered.
With the flags, both APIs are listed (v1; v0 to v2) and every connection starts as a stranger. Test:
`tests/sasl::the_sasl_apis_are_listed_only_by_a_broker_that_has_sasl`,
`tests/sasl::a_broker_without_sasl_serves_from_the_first_request_and_closes_on_a_handshake`,
`connection::tests::login::without_sasl_a_handshake_is_not_a_request_the_server_offered`,
`kafka-wire profile::tests::the_two_sasl_apis_need_both_the_feature_and_a_handler`; every pre-existing test is the rest of the proof.

## SEC-2. What a stranger may send, in order
Before the handshake: one ApiVersions (answered in full), then SaslHandshake. Anything else is closed unanswered: a
SaslAuthenticate without a handshake (`no-handshake`), any other API (`no-login`), a second ApiVersions (`versions-twice`).
After the handshake only SaslAuthenticate is welcome. Once logged in every API is served, ApiVersions included (`versions-first`),
except the two SASL ones (SEC-10). Test: `session::tests::a_stranger_may_ask_apiversions_once_and_then_handshake_and_nothing_else`
(every state against every served API), `..::after_the_handshake_only_a_token_is_welcome_and_two_apis_are_answered_then_closed`,
`..::a_logged_in_connection_is_served_everything_but_the_two_sasl_apis`, `tests/sasl::a_request_before_the_login_is_closed_without_an_answer`.

## SEC-3. The verdict is on the header; a stranger's body is never decoded
`header::split`, then `Session::admit(key)`, then (only if served) `Incoming::decode`. A Metadata with a body that does not decode
is "out of order" from a stranger and "a bad body" from a logged-in client. Test:
`connection::tests::login::a_strangers_body_is_not_decoded_but_a_logged_in_clients_is`.

## SEC-4. Limits before the login
A stranger's frame is capped at 512 KiB (Kafka's `sasl.server.max.receive.size`; it was 1 MiB), whatever the API; a logged-in
client's cap is the API's own (Produce 100 MiB). From the accept, a connection has 30 s to finish logging in, counted once and
not restarted by each request (**deviation SEC-D2**: Kafka has no such limit; the Go edition has this one). Test:
`frame::tests::an_unauthenticated_connection_is_capped_at_half_a_mib`, `frame::tests::the_caps_are_exact`,
`connection::tests::login::a_stranger_frame_is_held_to_512_kib_and_a_logged_in_one_is_not`,
`..::a_connection_that_does_not_log_in_within_the_budget_is_closed_however_it_trickles`, `..::the_budget_ends_with_the_login`.

## SEC-5. A request in the middle of a login
After a successful handshake and before the token: ApiVersions is answered ILLEGAL_SASL_STATE (34) with no APIs, at the request's
own version (`versions-before-token`); a second SaslHandshake is answered 34 with no mechanisms (`handshake-twice`); in both the
connection is then closed. Any other API is closed unanswered (**deviation SEC-D1**: Kafka answers it in its own shape, each
topic 34 and no brokers; the Go edition closes, as this does; needs the stranger's body decoded, which SEC-3 forbids). Test:
`kafka-wire api_versions::tests::the_answer_to_an_apiversions_in_the_middle_of_a_login_is_illegal_sasl_state_with_no_apis`,
`tests/sasl::apiversions_before_the_handshake_is_answered_once_and_after_it_is_illegal_state`,
`session::steps::tests::a_handshake_in_any_other_state_is_34_with_no_mechanisms_and_changes_nothing`.

## SEC-6. SaslHandshake
The mechanism must be offered, exactly: case-sensitive, so `plain`, `""`, `BOGUS` and an unconfigured `SCRAM-SHA-256` fail
(`unknown-mechanism`, `lowercase-mechanism`, `empty-mechanism`, `scram-not-enabled`). Success: error 0 and the list of offered
mechanisms. Failure: UNSUPPORTED_SASL_MECHANISM (33) with the same list, then the connection is closed, so a following handshake
or token gets no answer (`refused-then-right`). **Served at v1 only** (v0 means "raw tokens follow" and is not served; **deviation SEC-D3**).
Test: `session::steps::tests::a_handshake_for_an_offered_mechanism_is_answered_with_the_list_and_moves_on`,
`..::a_mechanism_that_is_not_offered_is_33_with_the_list_and_then_closed`, `tests/sasl::an_unknown_mechanism_is_answered_with_the_list_then_closed`.

## SEC-7. The list is in Java `HashSet` order, not the configured order (source: SSA:181)
Kafka answers `new ArrayList<>(new HashSet<>(configured))`: a 16-bucket table, a name's bucket being its `String.hashCode` spread
(`h ^ (h >>> 16)`) masked to four bits, a bucket keeping insertion order. `PLAIN` and `SCRAM-SHA-512` share bucket 0, `SCRAM-SHA-256`
is in bucket 6: the full list is `PLAIN, SCRAM-SHA-512, SCRAM-SHA-256` (recorded in `sasl-scram`) however it was configured, unless
`SCRAM-SHA-512` was written before `PLAIN` (then `SCRAM-SHA-512, PLAIN, SCRAM-SHA-256`: the bucket keeps insertion order. The
task text said "whatever the flag order"; the source says otherwise for that one order, and the source is followed). Test:
`kafka-auth authenticator::tests::the_buckets_are_the_ones_java_computes`, `..::the_mechanism_list_is_in_java_hash_set_order`
(the table of kafka-semantics 3.8 and the other orders). Only PLAIN can be enabled in 8a.

## SEC-8. The PLAIN token, checked in this order (recorded `sasl-plain`; source: `PlainSaslServer`)
The token is `authzid NUL user NUL password`, bytes (not text). 1. Parts: exactly three, else `Invalid SASL/PLAIN response: expected 3
tokens, got N` where N is the number of parts counted up to four (no NUL or an empty token: 1; one NUL: 2; three NULs or a trailing
NUL or more: 4). 2. Empty user: `Authentication failed: username not specified` (checked first, so both empty gives this).
3. Empty password: `Authentication failed: password not specified`. 4. The password, compared in constant time and compared for an
unknown user too (against itself, then refused): `Authentication failed: Invalid username or password` for a wrong password, another
user's, a prefix, a longer one, an unknown user, a capitalised user and non-UTF-8 bytes alike. 5. Only then the authzid: empty or the
user is fine, anything else (an existing user, `admin`, a stranger) is `Authentication failed: Client requested an authorization id
that is different from username`. A wrong password hides the authzid refusal. A 64 KiB token is judged like any other. Test:
`kafka-auth plain::tests::*` (one test per recorded group, steps named in comments), fuzz target `plain` (`crates/kafka-auth/fuzz`,
`// fuzz:parser plain`, in the CI fuzz job).

## SEC-9. A failed login is answered, flushed, then the connection is closed
SaslAuthenticate error 58 (SASL_AUTHENTICATION_FAILED), `ErrorMessage` the SEC-8 text, empty bytes; the answer is written and the stream
shut down before the connection ends, so the client reads the text and not a reset (the harness reads the 58). The next request gets
nothing. Test: `session::steps::tests::every_recorded_refusal_is_58_with_kafkas_text_and_closes`,
`connection::tests::login::a_failed_login_is_flushed_before_the_close_and_ends_the_connection`,
`tests/sasl::a_wrong_password_is_answered_then_the_connection_is_closed`. Unlike Kafka there is no 100 ms delay before the answer
(`connection.failed.authentication.delay.ms`; not observable in any recording).

## SEC-10. A login is final: afterwards both SASL APIs are 34 and the connection stays
After success, SaslAuthenticate (the same token, another user's valid one, a wrong one, none) is error 34 with `SaslAuthenticate
request received after successful authentication`, and SaslHandshake (any mechanism, even `BOGUS`) is 34 with no mechanisms. The
connection stays open and the principal never changes (`twice`, `authenticate-v0/v1`). Both are answered without decoding the body.
Test: `session::steps::tests::a_second_token_after_a_login_is_34_whoever_it_names_and_changes_nobody`,
`tests/sasl::a_second_login_is_illegal_state_and_the_connection_and_its_user_stay`.

## SEC-11. The success answer
Error 0, `ErrorMessage` the empty string (not null), empty `AuthBytes`, `SessionLifetimeMillis` 0, at SaslAuthenticate v0, v1 and v2
(re-authentication is off). The principal is `User:<user>`; the authzid cannot change it. Test:
`session::steps::tests::the_right_token_logs_in_with_an_empty_message_not_an_absent_one`, `tests/sasl::a_client_that_logs_in_with_plain_can_produce_and_fetch`.

## SEC-12. An ApiVersions answered with an error does not use up the stranger's one (source: SSA:572-586, kafka-semantics 6.2)
UNSUPPORTED_VERSION (35, a client opening at a version not served) and INVALID_REQUEST (bad software name) leave the state as it was;
only the answer with the list uses the slot. Test: `connection::tests::login::an_apiversions_answered_with_an_error_does_not_use_up_the_one_a_stranger_has`.

## SEC-13. Nothing the client sent is logged, printed or put in an error
Not the token, not a password, not a user name from a failed login (a user name is logged only for a successful login, at debug, as
`principal=User:<name>`). Refusal texts are fixed strings; `End` values name an API key, never bytes; `Secret` has no `Display` and a
redacting `Debug`, `Credentials` and `Authenticator` print user names only; `--sasl-user` is parsed from text clap cannot echo, and the
CLI errors leave out everything after the colon. Test (a planted password through a failed login, a stranger's token and a good
login with TRACE logging on, in a test binary of its own so the logging is the process's): `tests/redaction::no_password_or_token_is_logged_at_any_level`;
`kafka-auth credentials::tests::debug_output_names_the_users_and_never_a_password`, `authenticator::tests::debug_output_shows_no_password`,
`plain::tests::no_refusal_repeats_what_the_client_sent`, `doze-kafka cli::tests::the_password_of_a_user_is_in_no_debug_output_of_the_arguments_or_the_settings`,
`cli::tests::sasl_flags_that_cannot_work_are_refused_with_the_go_editions_words`,
`connection::tests::login::nothing_a_connection_ends_with_says_what_the_client_sent`, and the process test
`sasl::a_broker_started_with_sasl_logs_a_client_in_and_serves_it_and_prints_no_password` (the real binary at `--log-level trace`).

## SEC-14. Credentials
Built from `(user, password)` at start, nothing stored. Refused: an empty name, a NUL in a name, an empty password, a password that
is not ASCII or holds a NUL (no SASLprep, so only the bytes every client sends the same way), a name given twice (the messages name the
user, never the password). Names are compared as bytes, exactly (`ALICE` is not `alice`). Test: `kafka-auth credentials::tests::*`.

## SEC-15. The crypto is one file wide
`kafka-auth/src/crypto.rs` is the only code that names `hmac`, `sha2` or `subtle`; PBKDF2 (one output block) and base64 (strict,
canonical, padded) are in-tree on top of it, pinned by RFC 4231 (HMAC), FIPS 180 (SHA), RFC 7914 and OpenSSL-made PBKDF2 vectors for
SHA-256 and SHA-512, the RFC 7677 example's salted password, RFC 4648 base64 vectors, and a differential test against the `pbkdf2` crate
(a dev-dependency). Unused by PLAIN: they exist for SCRAM (8c). Test: `kafka-auth crypto::tests::*`, `crypto::pbkdf2::tests::*`, `crypto::base64::tests::*`.

## The oracle, slice 8a (2026-11-12)
`sasl-plain` cannot be replayed whole yet: its fixture needs CreateACLs/DescribeACLs (slice 8b). With the fixture's ACL step made a no-op
in a scratch copy of the harness, every login step of the 41 connections matches the recording (handshake, token, 33, 34, 58 with the
exact texts, every close) except: `fixture-acls` (ACL API), and the 13 `*-who` Metadata probes that expect `for-bob` (or `for-alice`) to be
error 29 (needs ACLs). The steps `request-before-token-who` and the three ApiVersions list steps are the Go edition's own known
differences (SEC-D1 and the API list) and are not reported for a foreign binary.

## Deviations
- **SEC-D1.** A request in the middle of a login other than ApiVersions and SaslHandshake closes unanswered; Kafka answers it in its
  own shape with 34 and then closes. (Recorded `request-before-token-who`; the Go edition has the same difference.)
- **SEC-D2.** The 30 s login budget from the accept. Kafka has none.
- **SEC-D3.** SaslHandshake v0 (raw tokens) is not served; the request closes the connection.
- **SEC-D4.** No `connection.failed.authentication.delay.ms` (100 ms) before a failure is answered.
- **SEC-D5.** Passwords are not zeroed on drop (no `zeroize` dependency; the weight rule). They live in the process for its life and are
  never printed.
- **SEC-D6.** `Session::Unauthenticated` carries a flag (`versions_answered`) that the plan's enum did not (SEC-12 needs it).
